# CrowdCare
Decentralized safety net for the gig economy — mutual aid powered by crypto.
# CrowdCare Intellectual Property Pledge

CrowdCare was created by `JaguarJerm_CrowdCare` as a public good and mission-driven project. While we encourage learning, remixing, and contributing to this open system, we ask that the following principles be respected:

## ✅ What You Can Do
- Fork the code for educational or public-good purposes
- Build on it with attribution and alignment
- Contribute to the ecosystem with PRs or tokens

## ❌ What You May NOT Do Without Permission
- Clone and rebrand CrowdCare for commercial gain
- Use the CrowdCare name, design, or tokenomics without license
- Pitch the idea or product as your own to funders or accelerators

If you’re interested in licensing CrowdCare commercially or launching your own aligned instance, contact us directly:

Let’s build the future of care — together and with integrity.
